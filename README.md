# EditKaro.in: Dynamic Video Agency Portfolio [Frontend Only] :
A modern, full-featured frontend for a Social Media & Video Editing Agency, built to showcase project versatility and technical proficiency.

# Project Overview :
This is the official portfolio and contact hub for EditKaro.in. It is designed as a single-page application (SPA) to provide a seamless user experience, emphasizing visual impact and interactivity. The structure demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of modern web design principles and vanilla JavaScript engineering.

# Key Features & Functionality :
This website is more than just static design; it includes several dynamic, client-focused features:

Dynamic Portfolio Filtering: Users can instantly filter the work gallery by categories (e.g., Short-Form, Gaming, E-Commerce Ads) using JavaScript logic, providing quick access to relevant case studies.

Live Pricing Calculator: A core utility that allows prospective clients to get an instant, estimated quote based on service type, video duration, and required revisions—demonstrating complex form logic and dynamic UI updates.

Dark/Light Mode Toggle: A user-controlled theme switcher implemented using pure JavaScript and CSS variables, with an initial check for the user's Operating System preference (prefers-color-scheme).

AOS (Animate On Scroll) Integration: Utilizes the AOS library to deliver subtle, professional animations (fade-up, fade-right) as the user scrolls, enhancing engagement and perceived quality.

Robust Contact Form Validation: Implements client-side JavaScript validation (name, email format, message length) to ensure clean data submission and provide immediate user feedback.

Full Responsiveness: The design adapts flawlessly across all devices, from mobile phones to large desktops, ensuring optimal usability for all visitors.
